              Clients are responsible for:

            <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Client Materials</h3>
            <p>
              Clients retain all ownership rights to materials they provide to Watchtower Web, including logos, images, text, and other content. By providing these materials, clients grant Watchtower Web a license to use them for the purpose of providing the agreed-upon services.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Deliverables</h3>
            <p>
              Upon full payment of all invoices, clients will receive ownership rights to the final deliverables as specified in the project agreement. Unless otherwise specified in writing, Watchtower Web retains ownership of all preliminary designs, code, and other materials created during the development process but not included in the final deliverables.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Watchtower Web Materials</h3>
            <p>
              Watchtower Web retains ownership of all proprietary tools, processes, and methodologies used in the development process. In some cases, Watchtower Web may license third-party materials (such as stock photos, plugins, or libraries) for use in client projects. The terms of these licenses will be communicated to clients.

            <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              Payment terms will be specified in the project agreement or statement of work. Typically, projects require a deposit before work begins, with remaining payments due at specified milestones or on a regular schedule. Invoices are due upon receipt unless otherwise specified.
            </p>

            <p>
              If a client fails to make a payment when due, Watchtower Web reserves the right to suspend work on the project until payment is received. For overdue payments, Watchtower Web may charge interest at a rate of 1.5% per month.

            <p>
              Changes to the project scope, timeline, or deliverables must be requested in writing. Watchtower Web will evaluate change requests and provide an estimate of any additional costs or timeline adjustments. Work on approved changes will not begin until the client has agreed to the revised terms in writing.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 Cancellation</h3>
            <p>
              Either party may terminate a project by providing written notice to the other party. If a client cancels a project, they are responsible for paying for all work completed up to the date of cancellation, plus any non-refundable expenses incurred by Watchtower Web.
